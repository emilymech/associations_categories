This is the code for data cleaning, plotting, and analysis for the ERP project ASSCAT. The data come from an ERP study that presented prime-target pairs to participants and asked them to make semantic relatedness judgements. N400's and LPC's as well as behavioral responses were analyzed to investigate whether the left and right hemispheres processed the semantic relatedness similarly.
